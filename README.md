Perl6::Tracer
==============


Trace Perl6 code. 

Known limitations: if there is a BEGIN, there will not be any formatting. Also , if classes are imported from nqp.


Usage:


use Perl6::Tracer;


my $f=  Perl6::Tracer.new(); # create a new object

say $f.trace({},$content); #  trace the content

The returned program code will contain tracing statements beside the original code.

If you run the traced code, you will see what lines were executed.

Command line access:


perl6 trace.p6 -h

perl6 trace.p6 4 \<Dagrammar.p6 \>traced.p6

Example of traced code, note statements are inserted by trace.p6:

sub dump_node($node)
{
 note "line  19";say "matched";
 note "line  20";if ($node<regliteral>) {
 note "line  21";say "reg $node"~$node<regliteral>;
 note "line  22";}
note "line  23";}
